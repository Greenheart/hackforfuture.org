                <p>
                    Most people have heard about the climate crisis, and how we
                    rapidly need to bend the curve of global CO<sub>2</sub>
                    e-emissions downwards. Still, few people take action.
                </p>

                <p className="font-normal">We want to change that.</p>

                <h2 className="font-black text-4xl">How?</h2>
                <p>
                    As members of Hack for Future, we believe we can achieve
                    this by improving our climate communication. But raising
                    awareness is not enough. Good climate communication inspires
                    people by starting with
                    <span className="font-normal italic"> why </span>
                    they should take action, before exploring
                    <span className="font-normal italic"> how</span>.
                </p>

                <p className="font-normal">
                    That's why we are connecting creative people from all around
                    the world so we can solve this and #HackforFuture, together.
