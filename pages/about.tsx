                We initially organized 7 climate hackathons between October 2019
                - June 2020, but figured we wanted to focus more on building
                interesting projects rather than organizing events. That's why
                we now meet for weekly community calls to make regular progress
                on our projects and have fun together.

                network within the impact tech industry. Join us!
